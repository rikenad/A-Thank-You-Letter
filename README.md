# A-Thank-You-Letter
This is a 3D platformer game embedded with sentiments of gratitude towards folx who have supported me. It features a character's journey through unknown enclaves by-way of receiving support from others (NPCs and/or other players) and giving support to others (NPCs and/or other players), ending with the character in a space where they can shine as brightly as they can.



Game mechanics:
Scene environments differ in terms of different game mechanics that need to be engaged in for moving the character
Stepping in certain spots in environments prompt certain events, and interactions with certain entities prompt certain events



Character design:

EXTENSION POSSIBILITY
STIGMA-inspired
platform where players can receive hope/support from and give hope/support to others
Nier:Automata death messages-inspired, players' avatars can be "saved" in anywhere with a message regading hope they need or would appreciate receiving, and other players can interact with these "save" points (lingo subject to change)
